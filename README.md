# Resolvable Ambiguity

This is the repository that contains everything currently in progress regarding resolvable ambiguity. If you were referred here by a paper, please see [Papers](#papers).

There are a few 'subprojects':

- [`syncon-parser`](syncon-parser): the most exciting thing probably, an implementation of a syncon-based parser.
- [`syncon-mode.el`](syncon-mode.el): a very simple emacs major mode for the syncon definition language used by `syncon-parser`.
- [`paper`](paper): the paper submitted to ESOP 2019.
- [`pandoc-doc`](pandoc-doc): informal writings on what my thoughts were towards the beginning of the current phase of development, currently very much out of date.

# Papers

If you were referred to here from a paper and want to see the state of this repository at the time of that particular submission you can find those as tags ("releases" on GitHub).

[PADL 2019](https://github.com/miking-lang/syncon/releases/tag/padl-2019): A complete rework has happened since this paper, that among other things focused the project more on using ambiguity in programming language syntax instead of being a complete solution for both syntax and semantics.
