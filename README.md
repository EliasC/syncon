# Resolvable Ambiguity

This is the repository that contains everything currently in progress regarding resolvable ambiguity. There are a few 'subprojects':

- `pandoc-doc`: informal writings on what my thoughts were towards the beginning of the current phase of development, currently very much out of date.
- `paper`: the paper.
- `formalization`: mechanization and formalization of resolvable ambiguity.
- `syncon-parser`: the most exciting thing probably, an implementation of a syncon-based parser.
- `vpl-ambiguity`: a sketch of an implementation of an algorithm to check for resolvable ambiguity.
