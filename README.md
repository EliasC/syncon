# Papers

If you were referred to here from a paper and want to see the state of this repository at the time of that particular submission you can find those as tags ("releases" on GitHub).

[PADL 2019](https://github.com/miking-lang/syncon/releases/tag/padl-2019): A complete rework has happened since this paper, that among other things focused the project more on using ambiguity in programming language syntax instead of being a complete solution for both syntax and semantics.

# Resolvable Ambiguity

This is the repository that contains everything currently in progress regarding resolvable ambiguity. There are a few 'subprojects':

- `pandoc-doc`: informal writings on what my thoughts were towards the beginning of the current phase of development, currently very much out of date.
- `paper`: the paper.
- `syncon-parser`: the most exciting thing probably, an implementation of a syncon-based parser.
