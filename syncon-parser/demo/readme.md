The demo in this directory can be run using `make`, assuming `syncon-parser` is in your `$PATH` (see readme in parent directory for how to achieve that). It will compile the language definition `demo.syncon` to `lang.synconc`, then parse `demo.source` using that language. If both of these succeed without errors `out.html` will contain an interactive visualization of the abstract syntax tree, showing which parts of the source code is covered by which node.
